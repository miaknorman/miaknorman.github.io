    <h2>Driven leader who led the team to greatness and made history!</h2>

    <p>Carli Lloyd is someone that I look up to and strive to be one day. A hero is someone who works hard in everything they do and is a role model for others.</p>

    <p>Lloyd helped the U.S. Women's National Team win two Olympic gold medals in 2008 and 2012 and two World Cups in 2015 and 2019. She was named FIFA Women's World Player of the Year in 2015 and The Best FIFA Women's Player in 2016. She inspires many young athletes, including myself, to follow their dreams to play college and pro soccer and to work hard no matter what.</p>
